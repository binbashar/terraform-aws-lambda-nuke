# terraform-aws-lambda-nuke

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-nuke.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-nuke)


Terraform module which create lambda which nuke all resources on aws account

## Requirements

This role was developed using python lib boto3 1.9.46 Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Terraform versions

For Terraform 0.12 use version v2.* of this module.

If you are using Terraform 0.11 you can use versions v1.*.

## Caveats
This following resources are not supported because creation timestamp are not present:

*   Compute
    -   ecs
*   Database:
    -   dax

## Usage
```hcl
module "nuke_everything_older_than_7d" {
  source                         = "diodonfrost/lambda-nuke/aws"
  name                           = "nuke_everything"
  cloudwatch_schedule_expression = "cron(0 00 ? * FRI *)"
  exclude_resources              = "key_pairs,rds"
  older_than                     = "7d"
}
```

## Examples

*   [Compute-nuke](https://github.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-nuke/tree/master/examples/compute) Create lambda function to nuke compute resources on Friday at 23:00 Gmt

*   [Storage-nuke](https://github.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-nuke/tree/master/examples/storage) Create lambda function to nuke storage resources on Friday at 23:00 Gmt

*   [test fixture](https://github.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-lambda/tree/master/examples/test_fixture) - Deploy environment for testing module with kitchen-ci and awspec
